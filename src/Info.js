A separate Autopilot options package ($5,000) is required to unlock most of those features, including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and remote parking. Tesla says that another package can be added on top of that for $3,000 to bring full autonomous capabilities, although the actual implementation of it has yet to be finalized.`,

Swipe it on the car’s B pillar to unlock it, and place it on the center console to turn the car on. Unlike early versions of the Model S and X, the Model 3 is built to be a daily driver, with plenty of cupholders, door pockets, and console storage. The materials of the arm rests and doors feel ready for abuse. And the stitched synthetic material used for the premium seats is different than leather, but not inferior.  ',
